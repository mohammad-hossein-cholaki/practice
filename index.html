        <h3>collapse margin</h3>
        Collapsing margins happen when two vertical margins come in contact with one another.
        <br>
        
        If one margin is greater than the other, then that margin overrides the other, leaving one margin.
        <br>
        
        when both margins are positive, the bigger margin will be total vertical margin.
        <br>
        
        If one of the margin be positive and another be negative then The margin between two elements decreases
        <br>
        
        If both margins are negative, the margin that collapses is the bigger negative of those two.
        <br>
        
        If both margin are equal, One of the margins collapses
        <br>
        
        When two elements have a parent-child relationship, the child margin will be overridden by their parent margin. and if we adding 1px of padding, than we can use both of them.
        <br>
        
        The same would be true if we added border-top to the parent. As long as something solid sits between the parent and child, both margins will be used.
        <br>
        
        the margins of floating and absolutely positioned elements never collapse.
        <br>
        
        If there is no border, padding, inline content, height, or min-height to separate an empty block's margin-top from its margin-bottom, then its top and bottom margins collapse.
